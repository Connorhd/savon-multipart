## 0.9.7

* Initial version. Adds multipart support (SOAP with Attachments) to Savon v0.9.7.
  Please test and provide feedback so we can merge this into Savon proper.

## 2.0.0
* Rewrite of savon-multipart to work with Savon 2.0+
  This includes all of the existing functionality in savon-multipart
  for savon1, but in a way that will be easier to maintain.

# 2.0.2 (Current)
* Removes hardcoded version lock on Mail gem
